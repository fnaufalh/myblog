<h1>Hi everyone,</h1>

My first background was front-end engineer, and now I will become an UI designer and product designer thoroughly. It's a step for me to finding and increaseing the solid ownership to the product that I have, to give more impact, more experience to the user and usefullness for the product itself. The future, I want to have my own product. So, it's a short story about me.
