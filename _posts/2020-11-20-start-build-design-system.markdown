The design system very helps me to keep my consistencies to build a design guide with clear standards. Maybe you have good memories to remember what and how your design rules but is a different problem if you recall again for a long time or work with people in your team. They need a guide, what and how the rules of your design. No need to build a complete design system for the first time, you can start to build it with simple or basic rules, and improve it later. I will show you what I've done with the basic design system on my [RAL.nursery](https://dribbble.com/shots/14458518-MVP-Design-Concept-RAL-nursery) project.
