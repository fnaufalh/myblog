Hi, I want to share moments and my experience with what I have at the previous office ([Ralali.com](https://ralali.com)). Sometimes when we have an event like a festival, exhibition, or some event that we can interact with users, we often invited by our Engineering Manager to join the event. The goal is to help users directly if they need, what a nice **empathy**!

So we have a proper mini booth for users come to interact with the team, users visit the booth for any reason, some of them come with interesting deals with the product, some of them come for asked help or give us feedback about the app that we built. It's fun to interact with them directly, we got much insight into their need, behavior, and their feedback.

One interesting experience is we are the team that didn't just wait for users to come, but we have the initiative to split the team, some of us waiting on the booth, and some of us are looking for users around the event to did quick usability testing.

<h3>How Did We Do That</h3>

Okay, it's a simple preparation, and focus to handle the unconditional situation. In this case, 2 people from the team look for a user, both of you can divide tasks and you need to bring things below:
- **Timer**, you can use your watch or handphone to simple track their time when did some flow in our app e.g. the goal is to choose a product from the product list
- **Notes**, digital notes, or paper notes are allowed if you like, it's used to take a quick important note like the time their spend, the error they got, and their feedback. Keep it simple, and you can breakdown that later
- **Handphone**, maybe you need urgently call your team for technical debt that users experience it, or because of connection problems in the user's phone. We need to prepare this to maintain user **comfort** and their **trust**

If you think we have some magic things, you wrong! Our goal is to interact with the user, gave them quick help, feedback, and got their behavior. All of it to train and finding how we interact with a user, maybe this procedure is not proper to get comprehensive data about users, but if got nothing we didn't learn anything.

<h3>What Metrics We Got</h3>
We can simplify some [metrics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-metrics/) due to conditions in the event, at least it gave you a picture of how your product iterated later.
- **Success rate**, in the normal condition you got this metric in percentage, but here I think success or failure is enough
- **Time**, it's a time that users finish their task
- **Error rate**, you can adjust these metrics not rate in percentage, but I think you can take a note of where or what the UI elements often go wrong by users when achieving their goals.
- **Users Satisfaction**, you can ask them how they feel about using the app, is make it easy for them, or make it difficult for them.

That's a fun moment for me to learn how to conduct quick usability testing on the users. Better you try this to be brave and train your empathy to the users. The most important thing is you feel how you can help them, ease them, and got a smile from them. I hope this story can inspire you to initiate that and can give lessons to us. See ya!
